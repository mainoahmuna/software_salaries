# Software Developer Salary Prediction App

This Streamlit application predicts the salary of software developers based on their country, education level, and years of experience using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Overview

This application uses a machine learning model trained to predict salaries. Users can input their country, education level, and years of experience to obtain an estimated salary prediction.

## Usage

1. Select your country from the dropdown list.
2. Choose your education level from the available options.
3. Adjust the slider to indicate your years of experience.
4. Click on the "Calculate Salary" button to see the estimated salary based on your inputs.

## What I Learned

Through developing this application, I gained experience in:

- Integrating a machine learning model for predictions within a Streamlit application.
- Using pickle to serialize and deserialize trained machine learning models.
- Implementing user input features like dropdowns and sliders in Streamlit for interactive applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Files Included

- `app.py`: Main application script containing the Streamlit UI and logic for salary prediction.
- `salaryPredModel.pkl`: Pickled machine learning model for salary prediction.
